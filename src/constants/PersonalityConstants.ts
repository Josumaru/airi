const kuudere = `Kuudere is a Japanese term for a character who appears to lack emotions and often remains calm in stressful situations. Kuudere characters are often stoic and expressionless, and they tend to keep the same core traits throughout a narrative. Other traits of kuudere characters include being aloof, level-headed, and serving as a voice of reason during conflict.`
const yandere = `A yandere is a fictional character who is obsessed with their love interest and may become violent or commit other crimes to express their devotion. The term is a combination of the Japanese words yanderu, which means "to be sick," and deredere, which means "lovestruck". Yandere characters may appear sweet, caring, and innocent at first, but then suddenly become extremely devoted to their love interest, sometimes in a violent or psychotic way.`
